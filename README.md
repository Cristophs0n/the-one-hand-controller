ConsoleTuner Titan One and Titan Two devices enable crossover allowing you to use your favorite controller on Xbox One*, PS3, Xbox 360* and PC. It also converts your controller into a fully modded controller without installing any chip or wires, if that's your cup of tea! But this repo is dedicated to assistive technology only.
